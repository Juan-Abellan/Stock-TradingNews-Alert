<h1>Stock-TradingNews-Alert</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project we are going to create an automated alert SMS which is going to send us some news about the state of the stock market of the chosen company, in this case Tesla. We will only recieve this SMS if the positive difference  of the price is over a certain amount. To achieve this functionallity we will be working with the free/trial versions of two APIs, twilio, alphavantage and newsapi. At the end of the project we will upload our code to python everywhere to be able to run it every day helping us to make better decisions about our stock.
